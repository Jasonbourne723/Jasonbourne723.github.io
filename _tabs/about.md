## Hello!

I’m Tang Lei. Briefly about myself:
  - I am a Business Architect and Software Engineer based in Shenzhen China, with a focus on distributed systems, microservice platforms, and enterprise backend infrastructure.    I currently lead backend architecture and iteration management across multiple teams.

  - I served as a software architect, with 8+ years of engineering experience primarily in C# and .NET, and am now actively working with Go.    My technical interests center around messaging systems, scheduling platforms, and the design of reliable, horizontally scalable services.    I'm also developing KantMQ, a message broker inspired by Kafka, as a hands-on systems project.

  - In my spare time, I study foundational computer science topics—from operating systems and networks to distributed algorithms—and I am passionate about building things from first principles.    I believe that understanding system design deeply enables better engineering decisions and fosters resilient software.

  - Outside of work, I’m a dedicated strength athlete currently undergoing a 12-week fat-loss program with a focus on performance retention.    I train four times a week using RPE-controlled progression, blending GZCL and Texas Method principles, and track every lift meticulously.

  - If you share interests in distributed systems, messaging middleware, or programming language theory, I’d love to connect.    I occasionally write about my work and learning process, and I’m always up for a good conversation on system design.
